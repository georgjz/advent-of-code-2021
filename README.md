# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2021][aoc]. I'm using [Chez Scheme][chez] and [Haskell][haskell]. For giggles, also [APL][apl] (although with a tiny bit of cheating and not every day).

## Running the Code

For Scheme, use [Chez Scheme][chez]:

```bash
$ scheme <filename>.scm
Chez Scheme Version 9.5.5
Copyright 1984-2020 Cisco Systems, Inc.

Part 1: <solution to part 1>
Part 2: <solution to part 2>
```

For Haskell, use [ghci][haskell]:

```bash
$ ghci <filename>.hs
GHCi, version 9.0.1: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( Sonar_Sweep.hs, interpreted )
Ok, one module loaded.
ghci> main
"Part 1: <solution to part 1>"
"Part 2: <solution to part 2>"
```
